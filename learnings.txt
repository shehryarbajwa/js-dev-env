What did we learn:

1-It is better to create automation before running a project
2-First we create a package.json file
3-Then we add different dependencies in It
4-Then we run npm install
5-We use npm start to run our file
6-Within package.json we can add scripts

    "scripts": {
        "prestart": "node buildScripts/startMessage.js",
        "start" : "npm-run-all --parallel open:src",
        "open:src": "node buildScripts/srcServer.js",
        "localtunnel": "lt --port 3000",
        "share": "npm-run-all --parallel open:src localtunnel"
    }

7-At start we add npm-run-all --parallel to create a parallel running environment
8-Local tunnel is used to create a url which we can share to show work in progress
9-On pre-start, we use the chalk library to color our cli

10 - To transpile and use the latest JS features

{
  "presets": [
    "latest"
  ]
}

11- To transpile we need to add babel node to the scripts we need to run via babel
